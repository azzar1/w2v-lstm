# Train Char-To-WordEmbedding using Glove or Word2Vec

This project started as a way to learn more about Tensorflow Fold. The main idea was to train a Bi-LSTM to predict word embeddings from words. This for example avoid the use of the "Unknown" token that is usually used for tokens that do not apper in our vocab or that have small typos.

I publish the code even if this revelead to be a bad idea.
